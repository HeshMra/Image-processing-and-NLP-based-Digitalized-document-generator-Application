"The triple bottom line (TBL) is a sustainability-focused accounting framework that includes social, environmental and financial factors as bottom-line categories. Businesses, nonprofit organizations and government entities use the TBL to evaluate not only their financial performance, but the overall economic value they create and their social and environmental impact. Rather than only focusing on the standard financial bottom line, the TBL adds broader economic, social and environmental concerns to help measure how an organization affects its employees, the surrounding community and the environment as a whole. This is typically measured using the three P's: people, planet and profit.
Why is the triple bottom line important?
The triple bottom line is an important part of sustainability efforts in many organizations. It's a management concept that was designed to prompt business leaders to look beyond standard measurements of profit and loss and to think more deeply about how their company operates. For example, the TBL encourages executives to consider everyone who is affected by the organization. As a result, it can help drive business transformation within companies.
The TBL could also help mitigate some of the effects of climate change, especially when it's used by large businesses that consume substantial amounts of energy and other resources and often contribute heavily to air and water pollution.

"How Does a Bond Work?
Bonds have three components: the principal, the coupon rate, and the maturity date. These 3 components are used to calculate a bond's yield.
The principal of the bond, also called its face value or par value, refers to the amount of money the issuer agrees to pay the lender at the bond's expiration.
The principal of a bond is usually either $100 or $1000, but on the open market, bonds may also trade at a premium or discount on this price.
The coupon rate is the percentage of the principal paid back to the investor as interest. Whatever the principal is, the coupon rate is a percentage of that value.
The bond maturity date is the date on which the principal must be paid back to the bondholder.
The bond issuer will make interest payments while holding onto the investor's money, and will also pay back the principal of the bond.
Depending on whether the bond was sold at a discount or a premium, the principal of the bond may be slightly higher or lower than the original investment.

When considering further more about the bank process the bank provides corporate clients with letters of credit, shipping and other guarantees, import and export finance, SWIFT facilities, syndicated loans, and payment solutions, as well as project financing, securitization, investment advice and evaluation, working capital financing, domestic and international factoring, Internet banking, and bullion trading services. Actually when it comes to the commercial bank, it is a profit-oriented company that deals in money and credit. It is a financial institution that deals in money in the sense that it takes public deposits of money and keeps them secure in its custody. It also engages in credit, i.e., it extends credit to persons in need by providing advances from monies received as deposits. As a result, it acts as a mobilizer of savings in the economy. As a result, a bank is similar to a reservoir that houses household savings and provides interest-bearing loans to businesspeople and others who require them for productive purposes or investment.","A commercial bank is a type of financial institution that lends money for consumption and investment with the goal of making a profit and accepts deposits from the general public. To distinguish it from retail and investment banks, it can also refer to a bank or a division of a large bank that deals with corporations or large/middle-sized businesses. Private and public banks are both examples of commercial banks."

"Jaykay Marketing Services (Pvt) Limited brought the Keells Super to the Sri Lankan supermarket chain in 1991 to introduce a novel concept. First, Keells Super's main business was selling a wide range of products, primarily FMCG (fast-moving consumer goods), such as groceries, household goods, and other essentials that could meet the needs of that era's customers. The Nexus Mobile Loyalty Card scheme was developed in 2000 in response to a market trend. It added points to each bill that could be used later. As time went on, every supermarket offered payment options for prescriptions and utility bills. However, as a company that places a high value on meeting the ever-increasing requirements of its customers as well as the trends in the market, it opened its own bakery in numerous supermarkets, which resulted in an increase in sales. Later in 2018, JMSL was able to make a great change in the history of Sri Lankan supermarkets by changing the name of the first Keells Super location to Keells and turning it into a solar outlet.

"Corporate goals, such as sales quotas or increases in market share, do not always take into account employee motivation. Motivating employees is thus a challenge and an opportunity for firms that want to outperform their competitors. For a firm to achieve its goals, its employees must be motivated to perform effectively.
Empirical research conducted with employees of a subject firm,
OAISYS, echoed theories published by leading authorities in
journals, books, and online reports. These theories argue that
monetary incentives are not the primary drivers for employee
motivation. Clear expectations, communication of progress toward
goals, accountability, and public appreciation are common primary
drivers. A firm aiming to achieve superior performance should
focus on these activities. All firms strive to maximize performance. Such performance is
typically defined by one or more tangible measurements such as
total sales, earnings per share, return on assets, and so on. The
performance of a firm is created and delivered by its employees.
Employees, however, are not necessarily motivated to do their
part to maximize a firm�s performance. Factors that motivate
employees can be much more complex than corporate goals. This
report will define the problem of employee motivation in one
company and examine potential solutions.
OAISYS is a small business based in Tempe, Arizona, that
manufactures business call recording products. Currently OAISYS
employs 27 people. The business has been notably successful,
generating annual compound sales growth of over 20% during
the last three years. The company�s management and board of
directors expect revenue growth to accelerate over the coming
three years to an annual compound rate of over 35%. This
ambitious corporate goal will require maximum productivity and
effectiveness from all employees, both current and prospective.
OAISYS�s management requested an analysis of its current
personnel structure focused on the alignment of individual
employee motivation with its corporate goal.","while corporate goals such as sales quotas and market share are important, they do not always consider the employee's motivation. Motivating employees is crucial to the success of a company, and monetary incentives are not the only solution. Research conducted with OAISYS employees supports the idea that clear expectations, communication of progress, accountability, and public appreciation are primary drivers of motivation. Therefore, companies should focus on these activities to achieve superior performance. Companies that prioritize employee motivation will have a competitive advantage over those who solely focus on corporate goals without considering the needs of their employees."

This article reviews the case for business schools becoming more seriously involved in teaching and research in the field of entrepreneurship and small business. It begins by reviewing some of the global pressures that underpin the need for management schools to devote more serious attention to these phenomena. It then argues the central case for a clear conceptual stance to be taken on the relationship between small business and entrepreneurship as a basis for core programme and pedagogical design. It finally reviews the key issues of change that will confront business schools wishing to move into this area under the three headings of: involvement with the community; teaching and research; and organization design.,"This article advocates for business schools to prioritize teaching and research in entrepreneurship and small business. It discusses the global pressures driving this need and argues for a clear conceptual stance to guide program design. The article also highlights the challenges that business schools may face when moving into this area, including community involvement, teaching and research, and organizational design. Overall, the article provides a compelling case for business schools to take entrepreneurship and small business education seriously."
"The continued development of e-business models has triggered a dramatic transition of customers�roles in a variety of service production and delivery processes. In the coproduction of service, the scale and scope of customers� participation have been significantly transformed and enhanced by newe-business models and technology. This transition calls for a newunderstanding of customers� roles in service delivery systems. The concept of�customer efficiency�is crucial for the successful management of systems where customers are actively engaged in service production and delivery processes. This article presents the concept of customer efficiency management (CEM), studies its relationship with other key customer characteristics, and explores its potential impact on e-business management.","E-business models have transformed customers' roles in service production and delivery processes.

"How should we name our new journal? What could be the title, statement and scope differentiation content to brief our audience? Are those features described clearly and richly enough? Bottom line, does all of that have any association with bibliometric performance (output and citations)? Leading journals (e.g. Scientometrics, Journal of Information Science,Academy of Management Journal, or Research Policy) possess a cemented cumulative advantage , and these questions are not vertical priorities for their editors and administrators. Granted, publishing space in such journals is scarce, especially for researchers outside premier institutions in developing countries.  However, the landscape has been changing. Between 2019 and 2020, the bibliographic database Scopus added 820 new journals.  Six?percent of the journals were classified into the subject area of business, management and accounting (BMA). While new periodicals are emerging, readers and authors are eager to look around for journals with a clear and attractive title and statement/scope that eventually will catch or fit their attention, research interests and subsequent use. When it comes to choosing a journal probably to publish a researcher�s work from developing countries, some shortcuts can be considered � looking at journal rankings, indexation or manuscript-journal matching services (e.g. Elsevier�s or Wiley�s journal finder and Springer�s journal suggester). Masten and Ashcraft outlined the proper characteristics to avoid predatory and identify credible journals, such as (1) intuitive website, (2) clear editor and editorial board information, (3) clear publisher information, (4) clear archiving and indexing and (5) clear identification of the journal affiliation/sponsorship. This study focuses on the factors directly related to the questions outlined at the beginning of this introduction: an intuitive website, clear publisher information and journal characteristics, hereafter a journal�s mission statement (JMS). Semantic networks will be used for analysing the structure of titles and JMSs. Readability and lexical diversity metrics will be used for analysing JMSs� attributes. Titles were excluded from the latter analysis considering that titles per se are too short for exploring their lexical diversity or readability compared with JMS. On that count, this study contributes to a structural assessment of journal titles and JMS quality in terms of readability and lexical diversity. It also adds to the literature on strategic planning and scholarly communication meta-knowledge Results and open access data sets could help research institutions and editorial strategic planning activities to launch new journals or improve the JMS of existing periodicals. Following this introduction, we present the data, methods, and software used. Then, we present the discussion of the results. Finally, we outline the conclusions, limitations and further research agenda.","This article discusses the importance of having a clear and attractive title and scope differentiation for new academic journals.

The results could assist research institutions and editorial strategic planning activities to launch new journals or improve existing periodicals. Overall, this article provides valuable insights into the strategic planning and scholarly communication meta-knowledge of academic journal publishing."
"Identity is the cornerstone of one of the most important areas of study in recent years: corporate marketing (Balmer, 2008). This term provides the foundation for numerous concepts, such as corporate brand identity (Balmer, 2012). This identity type encompasses specific values and features that, associated to the corporate brand, represent an organisation and the products offered to the market (Balmer and Greyser, 2002).
Corporate brand identity is an effective strategic tool and an important source of sustainable competitive advantages, which provides multiple benefits to the organisations (Melewar, 2003). Its management, understood as a comprehensive view of the different dimensions that need to be internally managed and controlled by the organisation (Sim�es et al., 2005), is essential as corporate brand identity precedes and represents the basis for brand image. Overall, due to its growing importance, some authors have incorporated this concept as a key element of the new marketing paradigm (Alsem and Kostelijk, 2008).
Despite the relevance of corporate identity management in recent years, there is little research that empirically explores this strategic resource (Arendt and Brettel, 2010; Sim�es et al., 2005). To date, previous studies have mainly focused on the definition and conceptualisation of this construct. Therefore, several authors advocate further exploration of the empirical impact of its management (Blomb�ck and Ram�rez-Pasillas, 2012). Within the services sector, the study of corporate brand identity management is specially relevant in the banking sector, which has been notably damaged by the economic and financial crisis. In addition to the financial problems, the banking sector has recently faced diminishing consumer trust and confidence (Colton and Oliveira, 2009). In this sense, a survey developed in the UK showed that a high percentage of customers, around 40%, were totally disengaged with their banks, whereas a 69% asserted that there are no clear differences among the banks (McEwen, 2010). In this context, it is critical to restore customers� trust and confidence, trying to convey a positive and coherent image with the essence of the organisation. It is in this complex process where corporate brand identity management and the role played by employees are crucial.
The aim of this research is, therefore, to gain a better understanding of the effects of corporate brand identity management. To reach this objective, corporate brand identity management is explored from the employees� perspective in a sector of great interest, the UK banking sector. In addition, the research analyses the relationship between corporate brand identity management and employees� attitudes and behaviours. Specifically, it assesses the effect of identity management on employees� commitment to the organisation, as well as the impact that such commitment has on their brand performance and satisfaction.
This research contributes to the literature in several ways. First, it extends previous research by providing empirical evidences on the study of corporate brand identity management and adopting the perspective of employees. Furthermore, the findings of this study offer useful guidelines on how to manage the corporate brand identity and provide helpful implications for banks and other organisations.


","Corporate brand identity is a crucial strategic tool that offers numerous benefits to organisations. Despite its importance, there is limited empirical research exploring its impact, especially from the perspective of employees. This study examines the effects of corporate brand identity management on employees' attitudes and behaviours in the UK banking sector, a field facing a crisis of customer trust and confidence. The research provides valuable insights into how to manage corporate brand identity and offers practical implications for banks and other organisations. Overall, this study highlights the need for a comprehensive view of identity management and the role played by employees in restoring trust and confidence in the banking sector."
"This article presents a method to help reflect on the relevance and effectiveness of development support. We illustrate the use of the method in the evaluations of two business coaching programmes targeting small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in developing countries. Both programmes were funded by the Netherlands Directorate-General of International Cooperation (DGIS). We used a (bi)annual online survey of SME managers receiving coaching as the core data collection tool to evaluate whether the business support programme could be considered a significant contributor to improved business performance.
The paper is organised as follows. First, we present the background of the intervention modality � business coaching � and explain why we opted for a perception-based survey tool. Second, we describe the business coaching activities of the two organisations involved, the theory of change, and the background to the impact evaluation. Third, we describe the perception survey and explain how to derive �contribution scores� from it, highlighting the design elements that allowed us to reflect on the reliability of the data. Fourth, we present the results, illustrating how contribution scores can help assess whether the intervention was a significant contributing factor in the wider, complex configuration of factors that created the development outcomes. Finally, we reflect on how the method could be used in other impact evaluations.
Business management and business coaching are complex processes. The business coach tries to influence and improve the behaviour of managers of SMEs who are constantly making decisions about changes in business strategy based on their interpretation of a set of complex, interrelated dynamics, including market signals, technical restrictions, the legal environment, human resource capacity, plans of competitors, and shifting financial realities. The business practices and management behaviour typically reported in the management literature include �more innovation and creativity, higher levels of initiatives or more flexibility and adaptability� (Blackman et al., 2016: 470). The coaching�coachee relationship is complex due to its sensitivity to personal characteristics and contextual features. The effects of the business coaching are in the manager�s head and may not be directly reflected in business performance indicators, as these are contingent upon many other factors and actors within and around the SME that shape the business strategy. Estimating the precise net effects of business coaching support on organisational outcomes is, therefore, virtually impossible. When evaluating the impact of business coaching on business performance, one must acknowledge that the support provided to managers is, at most, an INUS condition � �an insufficient but non-redundant part of a condition which is itself unnecessary but sufficient for the result� (Mackie, 1974: 62). The first part of this INUS definition is clear: the support needs to be combined with other conditions in order to work. The second part of the definition emphasises the need to consider alternative causal explanations � factors that may explain the result but have nothing to do with the support. Evaluating an intervention as an INUS condition follows the generative logic of causal inference (Stern et al., 2012). Data for generative inference can be collected using a wide range of methods (Pawson, 2013), including econometric methods that have a sequential (rather than generative) logic of pattern detection (Aston et al., 2021; Pawson, 2013). The important point is that the data allow a better understanding of the context sensitivity of the coaching outcomes. 
","This article presents a method for evaluating the relevance and effectiveness of development support through a perception-based survey tool. The authors applied the method to evaluate two business coaching programmes targeting small- and medium-sized enterprises in developing countries, funded by the Netherlands Directorate-General of International Cooperation. The complexity of business management and coaching makes it difficult to estimate the precise net effects of coaching support on organisational outcomes. Evaluating an intervention as an INUS condition allows for a better understanding of the context sensitivity of coaching outcomes. The contribution scores derived from the survey can help assess whether the intervention was a significant contributing factor in the wider, complex configuration of factors that created the development outcomes"
"Research on nature-based management has grown in interest at the intersection of environmental and organization studies, mostly driven by recent debates on sustainability-as-flourishing (Ehrenfeld & Hoffman, 2013; Schaefer et al., 2015) and novel discussions regarding the role that businesses might play in regenerating and sustaining natural ecosystems (Branzei et al., 2017). In practice, new breeds of enterprises are advancing sustainability efforts by building stronger links with nature. This includes sustainable enterprises promoting new forms of environmental accountability (Mu�oz et al., 2018), circular business models (Schneider & Clau�, 2019), and industrial symbiosis (Walls & Paquin, 2015). Also, �neo-farmers� (Vlasov, 2019) and �carbon cowboys� (Byck, 2020), who are leading revolutionary movements aimed at tackling climate change and restoring nature through holistic business activities (Branzei et al., 2018; Good & Thorpe, 2019).
Our examination of ecocentrism is informed by deep ecology (Naess, 2005, 1973). It emphasizes the inherent worth of living beings and calls for changes to modern lifestyle and the economic-centric view that dominates business management and environmental management more specifically. Given the many possible antecedents for the formation of ecocentrism, we examined and organized the literature on ecocentrism in management through the lens of Gosling and Case�s (2013) ecocentric framework. Leveraging their ideas on social dreaming and future imagining, we elaborate a model that organizes potential explanations of ecocentrism formation into three categories, reflecting ecological sensing, envisioning, and enacting. Using configurational comparative analysis, we mapped the responses of 160 environmentally-minded small business owners and managers in Chile, who took part in the 2018 National Survey on the Environment and Climate Change. We focus on this group since they tend to have more steering capacity than their counterparts in large corporations, which are mostly driven by shareholders� interests and professional boards. In SMEs, individual thinking is likely to translate into organizational actions. Our analyses reveal three configurations of conditions explaining the formation of ecocentrism in a business management context. Our work makes several contributions. First, we offer a conceptual framework and systematic characterization of ecocentric thinking and decision-making in business sustainability. Second, we provide an empirical typology comprising three distinct approaches to ecocentrism in business management, each of which constitutes a theoretical statement. They reveal that ecocentrism is indeed different, showing the unique ways in which it can materialize and how it distinctively departs from traditional anthropocentric logic. We show what matters and when for the formation of a more radical approach to environmental thinking and decision-making. In doing so, we advance sustainability-as-flourishing research and emerging streams of research, such as strongly sustainable business models, regenerative organizing, and holistic management. The article is structured as following. First, we review literature on ecocentrism in business sustainability, reflect on deep ecology as an alternative theoretical perspective and map out potential antecedents. After introducing our configurational approach, sample, and data, we present the results and explain how, combined, they create a typology of nature-based management. We conclude by discussing contributions to business sustainability literature, limitations and directions for future research.

"Within the game-based learning context, research on business simulation games (BSGs) has become more popular, especially for higher education and employee training in companies (Buil, Catal�n, & Mart�nez, 2018; Faria, 1998; Faria, Hutchinson, Wellington, & Gold, 2009; Faria & Wellington, 2004; Khan & Pearce, 2015; Sitzmann, 2011). BSGs refer to instructions provided by personal computers to immerse trainees in a manual business environment for decision-making and management knowledge to understand the consequences of their decisions without having to experiment in a real business environment (Sitzmann, 2011). Taking the most well-known Beer Distribution Game as an example, the role-playing simulation exercise of simple production and distribution system has been used in countless business education courses and widely studied in the literature because it was first developed at MIT Sloan School of Management (Costas, Ponte, de la Fuente, Lozano, & Parre�o, 2017; Kaminsky & Simchi-Levi, 1998). This simple game has proven to be very effective in helping trainees to understand the causal relationship between decision-making and supply chain behavior (Goodwin & Franklin, 1994). Understanding the predictors of students� behavioral intention to use BSGs is critical to enabling instructors to develop effective ways to strengthen business and management education techniques. Although previous studies recognized that BSGs have numerous benefits such as providing opportunities for students to improve their work-related business management knowledge and skills, and showed that BSGs usage has grown continuously (Faria, 1998; Faria & Wellington, 2004; Sitzmann, 2011; Wellington, Hutchinson, & Faria, 2017), little is known about why BSGs are adopted in education and what factors contribute to students� adoption behavior (Faria & Wellington, 2004; Gunawan, Fiarni, & Lawalata, 2015). In the information system (IS) literature, scholars have developed and validated a number of models such as the technology acceptance model (TAM; Davis, Bagozzi, & Warshaw, 1989) and the theory of planned behavior (TPB; Fishbein & Ajzen, 1975) to investigate user acceptance and information technology (IT) usage. Venkatesh, Morris, Davis, and Davis (2003) later synthesized these proposed models into the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT). The UTAUT proposes that four key elements (i.e., performance expectancy [PE], effort expectancy [EE], social influence [SI], and facilitating conditions [FCs]) and four moderators (i.e., gender, age, experience, and voluntariness of use) predict behavioral intention to use a system/technology and actual use behavior. The theory was later extended (UTAUT2; Venkatesh, Thong, & Xu, 2012) by incorporating three new key variables (i.e., hedonic motivation [HM], price value [PV], and habit [HB]). Within the specific context of the use of BSGs, little research has explored how UTAUT2 applies to and accounts for students� behavioral intentions. Therefore, drawing on UTAUT2 (Venkatesh et al., 2012), the aim of this article is to investigate how these constructs explain the use of BSGs.","The use of business simulation games (BSGs) has become increasingly popular in higher education and employee training, providing a safe and engaging environment for decision-making and management knowledge. While research has shown the benefits of using BSGs, little is known about why they are adopted in education and what factors contribute to students' adoption behavior. The unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT2) proposes four key elements and four moderators that predict behavioral intention to use a system/technology and actual use behavior. This article aims to investigate how UTAUT2 constructs explain the use of BSGs and contribute to effective business and management education techniques."
"Businesses are increasingly faced with economic sustainability challenges related to changes in the natural environment. In particular, natural disasters and shifting weather trends are noted as factors impacting short- and long-term strategic planning for businesses (Bergmann, Stechemesser, & Guenther, 2016; Craig & Feng, 2018; McKnight & Linnenluecke, 2019). Businesses are also forced to consider their roles to address social and environmental sustainability issues such as humanitarian crises, environmental degradation, and climate change (Aggarwal, 2011; Allen, 2016; Allen & Craig, 2016; Craig, Petrun Sayers, Feng, & Kinghorn, 2019; Delmas, Lim, & Nairn-Birch, 2015).
The challenges that businesses will face suggest that greater emphasis on sustainability should be guided by science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) competencies, which are noticeably absent from business literature and curricula. Sustainability programs are increasingly available to students across university curricula, but few specifically target business majors (Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education [AASHE], 2018; Hopkinson & James, 2010; Zwickle, Koontz, Slagle, & Bruskotter, 2014). Another challenge is the quality of integrated sustainability content into business programs. While some business schools may make modest strides by introducing students to sustainability content, �mainstreaming� sustainability-related issues requires integration across courses (Painter-Morland, Sabet, Molthan-Hill, Goworek, & de Leeuw, 2016, p. 738).
We make the case for developing cross-disciplinary STEM-based business sustainability curricula that enhance students� sustainability literacy (Zwickle et al., 2014) and cognitive abilities (Henderson, Mestre, & Slakey, 2015) related to STEM and sustainability. Specifically, we target student knowledge acquisition in STEM and sustainability (i.e., literacy) and student understanding and application of knowledge (i.e., cognition) specific to business. In the following sections, we review relevant literature related to STEM, sustainability, and business, outline our approach toward mending the curricular gap, and provide concluding comments.","In conclusion, businesses face increasing economic sustainability challenges related to changes in the natural environment, and STEM competencies can guide greater emphasis on sustainability. However, such competencies are noticeably absent from business literature and curricula. Therefore, we propose the development of cross-disciplinary STEM-based business sustainability curricula to enhance students� sustainability literacy and cognitive abilities related to STEM and sustainability, specifically in the context of business."
"Businesses are increasingly participants of globe spanning value networks, either as the orchestrating organization, or as the cog that provides essential goods and services. Through their involvement in global value chains (GVCs), businesses are exposed to diverging stakeholder expectations and pressures and to multiple legal, regulatory, and soft law requirements. Yet when something goes wrong, the largest company within the network or the supposedly most powerful organization is typically held to account by media, the public, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), or government. For example, most consumers may expect the fashion brand they buy from to be responsible for working conditions across the whole supply network, for example, to ensure that no child labor is present in the production of their jeans (Enderwick, 2018). How realistic is this expectation when there are many tiers of suppliers involved across different countries, from cotton picking to stitching the pairs of jeans together?
Rather than using heuristics of organizational size, we designed this exercise to challenge pre-conceptions (e.g., that the largest organization always has more power within a value chain). The exercise involves students engaging with a case study that involves multiple stakeholders within a GVC involved in a complex ethical situation. Students work in small groups on a card sort task to identify and understand which actors within the case study�s GVC (and potentially beyond) could be considered accountable, knowledgeable, or able to effect change. Students must discuss and debate to reach a decision within their group and then articulate their position as part of class discussion.
We have designed the exercise to be flexible, and it can be applied to a wide range of case studies and problems. The exercise is suitable for Business Ethics, Corporate Social Responsibility, International Business, and Supply Chain undergraduate and postgraduate courses. With a single instructor the exercise can be run with eight to 40 students. The exercise can be run in a single 60-minute session, extended to 90 minutes, or divided across three sessions. While the activity has been delivered with an online class, the available virtual learning platform may reduce the interactive nature of the card sort task, and therefore, in-person delivery is recommended.
We originally developed this exercise as part of an international multidisciplinary research project. Our research explored how modern slavery was identified and tackled within GVCs, and we used this exercise with an international fashion GVC from retailers in the United Kingdom through to small scale cotton spinners in India, including policy makers and NGOs from both countries. We have used the activity successfully in the United Kingdom with Japanese pupils, undergraduate students from management and social science backgrounds, international business masters students, and at international management conferences with academic colleagues.

","In today's globalized world, businesses are often involved in complex value networks, making it difficult to determine accountability when ethical issues arise. Traditional assumptions about organizational power and size may not apply in these situations, and new approaches are needed to address these challenges. We propose an exercise that challenges students' preconceptions and helps them identify the stakeholders who are accountable, knowledgeable, or able to effect change in a given situation within a global value chain. This exercise is suitable for undergraduate and postgraduate courses in Business Ethics, Corporate Social Responsibility, International Business, and Supply Chain. It has been successfully used in various settings, and we recommend in-person delivery to maximize interactivity."
"Gig economy is being increasingly popular globally across the sectors, positions and types of jobs. Despite the growing awareness of the benefits and challenges associated with gig jobs, little is known about what drives the younger generation to take up gig careers. The present study attempts to address this gap and better explain gig work intentions through extended TPB theory. The study rests on the premise that job seekers� attitude towards gig jobs, belief in self-efficacy and the prevailing social norms influences the decision to make a gig career choice. Apart from these basic constructs of TPB model, impact of two additional factors (gig personality traits and gig work environment consisting of gig job demands and gig job resources based on JD-R model) on gig job intentions was measured to get a deeper understanding on predictors of gig jobs choices. Based on analysis of 471 responses from business management students studying in NIRF listed business schools in India, the study empirically reveals that all three basic constructs-gig job attitude, gig self-efficacy and social norms significantly influence management student�s gig job intentions. Gig job demands had a significant negative whereas gig job resources had a positive relationship with gig job intentions. The three personality traits did not have any direct significant relationship with gig job intentions. But the mediating role of gig job attitude between gig personality traits was also confirmed. The findings of the study contribute to literature on factors driving choice of gig jobs. It has huge implications for policy makers, organizations, business schools as well as society in general.","This study examines the factors driving the younger generation's choice to pursue gig careers through an extended TPB theory. The study finds that attitude towards gig jobs, belief in self-efficacy, and prevailing social norms significantly influence gig job intentions. Additionally, gig job demands have a negative impact while gig job resources have a positive impact on gig job intentions. The findings of the study provide valuable insights into the factors driving the choice of gig jobs and have significant implications for policy makers, organizations, business schools, and society as a whole."
"Action research (hereafter AR) is an approach to research that aims to both take action and create knowledge or theory about action (Coughlan & Coghlan, 2002). A simple search of the term �Action Research� on �Google Scholar� yields to an incredible return of 1,250,000 results. Limiting the search to the last 2 years, 580,000 results are found. These data give a first view of the interest of this methodology and its increasing use in academic contexts.
There are many definitions of AR, but one of the most frequently cited appears in Rapoport (1970): �Action research aims to contribute to the practical concerns of people in an immediate problematic situation and to the goals of social science by joint collaboration within a mutually acceptable ethical framework� (p. 499). In this way, AR brings together researchers and, in the case of business research, organizations. In other words, AR tries to understand problems (research) and give them a justification through practice (action), that is, it has a practical nature. Both the research and the action itself are part of the results of this process. Moreover, the participation of the organization in the study increases both the authenticity and the trustworthiness of the results because the analysis is conducted in a collaborative manner (Argyris & Sch�n, 1991). Thus, the researchers obtain more rigorous information, and the study is more valuable for the entity that carries it out.
The aim of this article is to underscore the definition of AR as a meta-methodology that encompasses different ways of carrying out empirical research, and we focus our study in the management field. In this way, this article enriches the AR literature and supports other references, such as Coghlan and Brydon-Miller (2014) and Dick et al. (2015), that also highlight the role of AR as a meta-methodology in two ways: (1) In terms of AR field, even there are papers that signal that this methodology includes different gathering methods, this study gives one-step ahead, and it highlights that it should be considered as a meta-methodology, that is, an �umbrella� that coexists with other quantitative and qualitative methodologies. (2) With respect to business/management field, this article should encourage researchers in operations, marketing, and human resources that AR is not only a methodology that can be analyzed as an extended case study if not that can serve as a framework to those studies that are based in dual contribution and where there is an active collaboration between researcher and practitioners. In order to get these objectives, we conduct a systematic review of the implementation of AR in the business field.
In short, this article proposes an updated review of previous research on AR in business fields, whose main objective is to analyze the methodologies used in these articles and propose several conclusions to foster AR in further studies.

","In conclusion, action research (AR) is a methodology that combines research and practice to understand and solve problems in a collaborative manner. With an increasing number of publications on AR in the last few years, this article emphasizes the definition of AR as a meta-methodology that can enrich empirical research in management. By conducting a systematic review, this study aims to provide insights into the implementation of AR in business fields and encourage further studies based on the principles of AR."
"In 2001 the government launched a professionalization development programme to train 1,000 School Business Managers (SBMs) (previously known as �bursars� who are responsible for managing the non-teaching activities required to run a school) by 2006, a target that was exceeded. In 2010 the Academies Act (Department for Education (DfE)) gave all local authority maintained schools in England the right to convert to academy status. The resultant significant increase in business management functions in those converter schools fell to SBMs to accomplish, thus increasing schools� reliance upon SBMs.
Leadership opportunities for SBMs continue to increase as schools are encouraged to become academies and join a multi-academy trust (MAT) resulting in significantly increased statutory business management requirements. Evidencing this, Toop, the CEO of Ambition School Leadership (2017: 1) stated that, �The increase in numbers of MATs has created a range of career opportunities for SBMs that have not previously existed � from SBM to finance director, to chief operating officer at a MAT, to CEO � bringing a different professional background into the sector�. This was confirmed by the Institute of School Business Leadership (ISBL), the professional body for SBMs, in its School Business Professional Workforce Survey report which found �evidence of more career mobility for [survey] respondents in MAT structures/schools than single school settings� (2020: 8).
The purpose of this paper is to explore whether these leadership opportunities really do exist and, if so, what are the perceived constraints for SBMs wishing to progress to these roles. The paper also explores what the appetite (defined as an �intention� rather than just �interest� in) among SBMs is to progress to leadership positions. This research is important because as more schools become academies and join MATs, the more senior leadership roles require business management skills not generally found in pedagogical leaders. The need for such skills has been further illustrated by the contribution of SBMs to school leadership during 2020 as a result of COVID-19 (The Key, 2020a). Both of these issues demonstrate the need for SBMs to step up into more senior leadership roles. Finally, given the increasing importance of the SBM role in the school sector and the existing paucity of research into SBMs (Armstrong 2016; Starr, 2012), this research adds valuable knowledge.","the government's 2001 professional development program exceeded its target of training 1,000 School Business Managers (SBMs) to manage non-teaching activities in schools. Following the Academies Act of 2010, schools converting to academy status resulted in an increased reliance on SBMs to handle business management functions. The rise of multi-academy trusts (MATs) has led to an increase in career opportunities for SBMs. However, this paper aims to explore whether these opportunities exist and what constraints may hinder SBMs from progressing to leadership positions. The research is essential in highlighting the need for SBMs to step up to senior leadership roles due to the increasing importance of the SBM role in the school sector."
"Increasing numbers of university students are working part-time while studying and, as a consequence, several academic studies have highlighted the adverse impact of this practice on academic performance. This has led to suggestions for changes in educational policy, seeking either to reduce students� term-time working or to eliminate it altogether. However, this perspective overlooks the opportunity for academics to integrate and use students� part-time work activities to enhance the learning experience.
With a gearing to business management education, it is argued that the integration of students� work experience into the classroom can give them greater control of the learning process and so lead to deeper learning.
In the United Kingdom, the number of full-time university students working part-time alongside their studies is increasing (BBC, 2015), primarily because of financial need (Crockford et al., 2015). As a consequence of this increased work activity, various academic studies have examined the detrimental effect of part-time working on academic performance (Broadbridge and Swanson, 2005; Callender, 2008; Curtis, 2007), especially where weekly work hours have exceeded 15 (see, e.g. Curtis and Shani, 2002). These studies have fuelled academic debate on how to address the problem, with Hall (2010), Hodgson and Spours (2001) and McVicar and McKee (2002) suggesting a review of educational policy to reduce the attractiveness of or necessity for working while studying. According to Gil (2014), some universities actively discourage students from working during term time to prioritise studies.
However, the fact that working while studying now seems to be the norm for contemporary full-time university students has led to suggestions that universities should perhaps be more receptive and flexible with regard to students� part-time employment needs (Robotham, 2012). By seeking to eradicate or minimise students� part-time working, academics are seemingly overlooking the opportunity that such work experience might bring to the classroom to enhance the learning experience. This suggestion of a more formal connection of students� studies with the non-academic work they do during their time at university is consistent with the argument of O�Connor and Cordova (2010), who advocate convergence between individuals� study and work to maximise development opportunities. This argument is supported by the finding of Ehiyazaryan and Barraclough (2009) that student learning is maximised when practical work examples can be integrated into the classroom. Similarly, connecting theoretical frameworks with students� own work experiences supports the recommendations of Major (2005), who feels that effective learning is best facilitated by presenting learners with an opportunity to become involved in the relationship between theory and practice, rather than seeing them as separate entities. Darolia (2014) and Evans and Richardson (2017) even recommend that students should be awarded academic credit for part-time work activities, and therefore that such activities should be more formally embedded in assessment regimes.

","the trend of increasing numbers of full-time university students working part-time alongside their studies has raised concerns about the negative impact on academic performance. However, this paper argues that universities should not overlook the opportunity to integrate students' work experience into the classroom to enhance the learning experience. By connecting theoretical frameworks with practical work examples, students can have greater control of the learning process and deeper learning can be facilitated. Therefore, instead of seeking to eliminate or reduce students' term-time working, universities should consider being more receptive and flexible with regard to students' part-time employment needs, and even award academic credit for part-time work activities."
"Greater cross-border competition means that nowadays there is no firm capable of staying competitive by relying on entirely on its internal resources and capabilities (Contractor et al., 2010; Das and Teng, 2000; Suarez and Garc�a-Canal, 2003). While this need of accessing external resources is common to firms in all sectors, the need to collaborate with external agents�i.e. suppliers, customers, competitors, universities or institutions�is even more evident in technological sectors (Kedia and Mooty, 2013; Quintana Garc�a and Benavides Velasco, 2007). More must be done with limited R&D budgets, as products and services are increasingly multi-technology, and this growing breadth of competences raises the costs and the associated risks (Leiponen and Helfat, 2010). Firms are forced to innovate at a faster rate so as to maintain their competitiveness in the market and, as a result, they see technological or R&D alliances not as an option, but as a strategic need (Cassiman and Veugelers, 2006). Previous literature has shown that accessing external technological knowledge through R&D alliances may help firms to reduce time-to-market, develop innovations that otherwise could not be done internally, improve the quality and efficiency of the innovations developed, as well as facilitate the access to new markets (Narula, 2001). This reflects a broader phenomenon, as cooperation at all aspects of the value chain is an essential part of economic activity, as seen by the growth in global value chains (Hern�ndez and Pedersen, 2017) and innovation networks. In addition, universities, research institutes (not to mention governments, and supra-national organisations) all seek to create greater efficiencies. R&D cooperation is a complex activity, as given its strategic role and usually tacit and firm-specific nature, is an activity that, if poorly planned and managed, has long-term consequences that can threaten firm's survival.
Despite the benefits, R&D alliances are risky (Monteiro et al., 2017). They require partners to transfer and communicate technological knowledge that is usually difficult to codify and protect, thus generating important hazards for the partners (Cantwell and Santangelo, 1999; Oxley, 1997). This means that firms have to try to maximise coordination and communication so as to fully benefit from the partner's external knowledge, while at the same time protecting their knowledge from undesired technological leakages (Grimpe and Kaiser, 2010; Mart�nez-Noya et al., 2013). In other words, firms face an inter-organisational learning dilemma (Larsson et al., 1998). This tension between knowledge sharing and knowledge protection may lead to other paradoxes when selecting alliance partners, such as a higher preference for familiar and nearby partners especially for more radical projects (Li et al., 2008) which may bias partner selection decisions and lead to the paradox of embeddedness (Uzzi, 1996, 1997).
For this reason, the aim of this paper is to review the literature on R&D alliances to summarise what we know and identify the main challenges for future research. We believe that, despite the vast literature analysing R&D cooperation, there are many dimensions of R&D alliances that require a better understanding. Given their strategic nature, R&D alliances provide important insights into other types of alliances as they require greater diligence and planning. 

","In today's global economy, firms cannot rely solely on their internal resources and capabilities to stay competitive due to increased cross-border competition. Technological sectors require collaboration with external agents, leading to the need for R&D alliances to innovate at a faster rate and maintain competitiveness. While R&D alliances offer benefits such as reduced time-to-market and improved quality and efficiency of innovations, they are also risky due to the difficulty in protecting knowledge from technological leakages. Firms face an inter-organisational learning dilemma, leading to paradoxes when selecting alliance partners. Future research must focus on understanding the many dimensions of R&D alliances to provide insights into other types of alliances, given their strategic nature."
"The concept of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) has evolved over the years since it was defined by Bowen (1953) as the obligation to implement policies, make decisions, and follow desirable strategies in terms of objectives and values for the society, to be conceived as an integration of social, labor, environmental, and human concerns in the procedures and policies of the company on a voluntary basis (Ros-Diego & Castell�-Mart�nez, 2012). A socially responsible company must not only comply with the legal requirements that apply to it, but also go one step further and invest in human capital, the environment, and the promotion of a proactive relationship with its stakeholders (Czinkota et al., 2018).
The transcendence and importance of CSR has been growing and receiving increasing attention from the academic world, the media, society, and politics (Gatti et al., 2019), since The United Nations adopted the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 2015 (ElAlfy et al., 2020). CSR has gone from being a trend or marketing tool (Lin et al., 2020), to becoming an intangible asset for organizations of any size and country (Garc�a-Hern�ndez et al., 2017), making many of them adopt CSR as an essential element of their business plan (Ikram et al., 2020). In this sense, despite the great interdisciplinarity of the concept, much of the academic production is focused on the field of business (Ji et al., 2020), something that limits the construction of new research perspectives that allow delving into the topic.
Throughout the literature, there are works that analyze the concept of CSR from different perspectives that coincide with its three pillars: economic, environmental, and social. First, from the economic perspective, although it is true that many studies speak of CSR as a source of economic benefits for companies, the debate on the relationship of CSR practices with financial performance has been alive for many years (Bahta et al., 2020). In this sense, as pointed out by Abad-Segura et al. (2019) much of the research in CSR has been focused on the areas associated with business, management, and accounting, in search of reaching a clear conclusion that has not been achieved so far, being able to find research that conclude that a company that dedicates resources to fulfilling what is perceived as its social responsibilities can obtain a better, worse, or equal financial performance than if it had done it in another way (Kurucz et al., 2008). From the business management point of view, it is essential to know the impact of CSR on financial performance in order to know how and when to invest in the development of ethical and socially responsible practices (Bhardwaj et al., 2018).
","In conclusion, Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) has evolved over the years to become an essential element of the business plan for organizations. A socially responsible company not only complies with legal requirements but also invests in human capital, the environment, and a proactive relationship with stakeholders. While much of the academic research on CSR is focused on the economic, environmental, and social pillars, the relationship between CSR practices and financial performance remains a topic of debate. Despite this, understanding the impact of CSR on financial performance is crucial for businesses to invest in ethical and socially responsible practices. Overall, CSR is an intangible asset for companies of any size and country, and its importance continues to grow in today's society."
"Alcohol  and  drug  treatment  services  in  the  Nordic  countries  are  under  increas-ing  pressure  to  develop  and  co-ordinate  services  better  for  the  users.  The  services  should  meet  not  only  the  more  complex  needs among users, they must also adapt to new  government  control  signals,  reforms,  academic  progress  and  to  more  squeezed  municipal finances. It is in the balance of political,  professional  and  economic  ex-pectations  and  considerations  that  drug  services must find their future form.This article focuses on the driving forc-es behind the development of alcohol and drug  treatment  services.  Based  on  experi-ences  in  three  Nordic  cities,  Stavanger  in  Norway,  Ume�  in  Sweden  and  Aarhus  in  Denmark,  the  article  highlights  the  scope  of service development and which factors are  pushing  innovations  in  alcohol  and  drug  treatment  services.  All  three  urban  municipalities  are  part  of  the  Scandina-vian health system which, in international comparisons,  is  classified  as  a  decentral-ised  National  Health  Service  (NHS)  sys-tem.  The  health  services  are  tax-funded  and provided mainly by public providers. The content of alcohol and drug treatment services   offered   in   the   three   countries   has  many  similarities.  The  service  shall  be  universal  and  meet  needs  regardless  of  the  user�s  place  of  residence,  gender  and  socio-economic  status.  Alcohol  and  drug  treatment  in  the  Nordic  countries  has  clear  similarities  in  the  composition  of both health personnel and user groups, and the services developing are driven by many governmental similarities (Edman & Stenius, 2007).In the debate about implementing New Public  Management  (NPM1)  into  alcohol  and  drug  treatment  it  has  been  argued  that this may compromise service quality and  that  the  market  is  not  a  good  way  to  distribute  services  between  clients  with  different  levels  of  information,  varying  degrees  of  real  choice  and  varying  pos-sibilities  to  correct  wrong  choices.  It  has  been  argued  that  NPM  cannot  substitute  the  political  decisions  that  will  distrib-ute  services  to  all  those  who  need  them  (Stenius, 2011). This and other similar po-sitions may be interpreted as the services having  become  unwilling  and  resigned  subjects  of  governmental  health  policies.  This  article  assumes  that  quality  com-prises  three  organisational  principles:  i)  the services shall be available, ii) the ser-vices must be adapted to each individual, and  iii)  services  (collectively)  should  be  able  to  provide  continuity  of  treatment  (Nesv�g & Lie, 2010). We examine in par-ticular whether local service development stakeholders  have  the  scope  to  develop  services that support the principle of con-tinuity.  ","In conclusion, alcohol and drug treatment services in the Nordic countries are facing increasing pressure to develop and coordinate services better for users. This article has highlighted the driving forces behind the development of alcohol and drug treatment services in three Nordic cities, Stavanger in Norway, Ume� in Sweden, and Aarhus in Denmark. Despite similarities in the composition of health personnel and user groups, there are concerns about the impact of implementing New Public Management (NPM) on service quality. The article emphasizes that quality comprises three organizational principles: availability, adaptation to individual needs, and continuity of treatment. It is essential for local service development stakeholders to have the scope to develop services that support the principle of continuity."
"Leadership is a critical element in organizational success. The ability of a leader to inspire, motivate, and guide their team can have a significant impact on employee performance, satisfaction, and the overall success of the organization. Different leadership styles have been identified and studied, each with its own unique characteristics and effects on organizational outcomes.

Transformational leadership, for instance, is characterized by the leader's ability to inspire and motivate employees to go beyond their self-interests for the benefit of the organization. Transactional leadership, on the other hand, relies on rewards and punishments to motivate employees to achieve specific goals. Autocratic leadership involves a leader who makes decisions without input from subordinates, while democratic leadership encourages participation and collaboration among team members. Finally, laissez-faire leadership involves a hands-off approach, with the leader providing minimal guidance and supervision.

Each of these leadership styles can have different effects on employee satisfaction, motivation, and performance, as well as the overall performance of the organization. Transformational leadership has been linked to higher levels of employee satisfaction, motivation, and commitment, which can lead to improved performance and increased productivity. Transactional leadership, while effective in achieving specific goals, may not be as effective in promoting employee satisfaction and long-term performance. Autocratic leadership may lead to low levels of job satisfaction and decreased motivation, while democratic leadership can lead to increased job satisfaction and higher levels of motivation.

Understanding the different leadership styles and their effects on organizational performance is crucial for managers and executives. By choosing the right leadership style for their organization, leaders can inspire and motivate their employees to achieve their goals and improve the overall performance of the organization. In this paper, we will explore the various leadership styles and their impact on employee satisfaction, motivation, and productivity, as well as the overall performance of the organization. By doing so, we hope to provide insights into the most effective leadership styles for different organizational contexts and goals.","leadership plays a crucial role in organizational success.

"Strategic planning and implementation are critical components of effective business management. Strategic planning involves the development of a long-term vision for the organization, identifying its goals and objectives, and outlining the steps necessary to achieve them. Implementation, on the other hand, involves the execution of the plan and the allocation of resources necessary to achieve the organization's goals. Together, these processes enable organizations to anticipate and respond to changing market conditions, identify new opportunities for growth, and position themselves for long-term success.

In today's dynamic and competitive business environment, strategic planning and implementation have become more important than ever. With the rapid pace of technological change, increasing globalization, and growing pressure to innovate and adapt to new market trends, organizations must be able to develop and execute effective strategies to stay ahead of the competition.

However, the process of strategic planning and implementation is not without its challenges. Organizations must navigate complex internal and external factors, including changing customer preferences, regulatory environments, and economic conditions. Effective planning and implementation require a deep understanding of the organization's strengths and weaknesses, as well as its competitive environment.

Moreover, successful strategic planning and implementation require the support and collaboration of all stakeholders, including management, employees, shareholders, and customers. Effective communication and leadership are critical to ensuring that everyone is aligned around the organization's goals and committed to achieving them.

In this paper, we will explore the key principles of strategic planning and implementation, as well as the challenges and opportunities associated with these processes in today's business environment. We will examine best practices and case studies from a range of industries, and provide practical insights and recommendations for organizations seeking to improve their strategic planning and implementation capabilities. By doing so, we hope to help organizations develop and execute effective strategies that drive long-term growth and success.","strategic planning and implementation are essential for businesses to thrive in today's dynamic and competitive environment. While the process can be challenging, with proper understanding, support, and collaboration from all stakeholders, organizations can effectively anticipate and respond to changing market conditions, identify new growth opportunities, and position themselves for long-term success. By examining best practices and case studies, organizations can gain practical insights and recommendations to enhance their strategic planning and implementation capabilities. With the right approach, organizations can develop and execute effective strategies that drive long-term growth and success."
"Effective communication is a critical component of successful business management. Clear and concise communication enables organizations to build strong relationships with their customers, employees, and stakeholders, and to foster a culture of collaboration and innovation. In today's fast-paced and highly competitive business environment, effective communication has become even more important as organizations strive to remain agile and responsive to changing market conditions.

Effective communication involves more than just speaking and listening. It requires an understanding of the different communication styles and preferences of individuals and groups, as well as the ability to adapt communication strategies to different situations and audiences. It also involves the use of different communication channels, including face-to-face communication, email, social media, and other digital platforms, to reach different audiences and achieve specific communication objectives.

Effective communication plays a critical role in all aspects of business management, from setting and achieving strategic goals to building strong teams and delivering excellent customer service. It is essential for establishing trust and credibility, resolving conflicts, and fostering a culture of continuous improvement and innovation.

"In today's interconnected world, global business culture plays an increasingly important role in shaping cross-cultural communication. With businesses operating across borders and continents, understanding and adapting to different cultural norms and practices is essential for successful communication and collaboration.

Global business culture encompasses the shared values, beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors that shape the way people from different countries and regions conduct business. These cultural differences can have a significant impact on communication, negotiation, and decision-making processes. For example, while some cultures value direct communication and assertiveness, others prefer indirect communication and harmony.

The impact of global business culture on cross-cultural communication is evident in many areas of business, including marketing, sales, and customer service. Understanding and respecting cultural differences can help businesses build relationships and gain trust with customers and partners from different backgrounds. On the other hand, cultural misunderstandings and miscommunications can lead to lost opportunities, damaged relationships, and even legal disputes.

As the world becomes more interconnected and businesses continue to expand globally, the importance of understanding and navigating cultural differences in cross-cultural communication will only continue to grow. Businesses that prioritize cultural competence and invest in cross-cultural training and development will be better equipped to succeed in today's global marketplace.","global business culture has a significant impact on cross-cultural communication, and businesses that prioritize cultural competence are more likely to succeed in today's global marketplace.

"Franchising has become a popular model for business expansion and growth in recent years. It involves the licensing of a company's business model, products, and trademarks to a third party (franchisee) who then operates their own business under the franchisor's brand and guidance. This model has proven to be effective in expanding businesses across different regions and even countries.

The franchisor provides the franchisee with a proven business model and a range of support services, including training, marketing, and ongoing operational support. In return, the franchisee pays an initial fee and ongoing royalties to the franchisor. Franchising offers several benefits for both franchisors and franchisees. For franchisors, it provides a faster and more cost-effective way to expand their brand and reach new markets. For franchisees, it offers the opportunity to own and operate a business with a proven model and established brand, without the risks and challenges of starting from scratch.

The impact of franchising on business growth is significant. Franchising allows businesses to expand rapidly and enter new markets, without the need for significant capital investment or the challenges of establishing a new brand. Franchisees are highly motivated to succeed, as their success is directly tied to the success of the franchisor's brand. This can lead to increased revenue, profitability, and market share for both the franchisor and franchisee.

However, franchising also comes with its own unique challenges, including maintaining brand consistency across different regions and ensuring that franchisees adhere to established standards and practices. The franchisor must provide ongoing support and training to ensure that franchisees are operating their businesses effectively and in accordance with the franchisor's brand standards.

Despite these challenges, franchising remains a popular and effective model for business growth. As the global marketplace continues to expand, franchising offers businesses a way to rapidly enter new markets and expand their brand presence.","franchising is an effective model for business expansion and growth that provides numerous benefits to both franchisors and franchisees. While it comes with its own challenges, such as maintaining brand consistency and ensuring franchisees adhere to established standards, franchising offers a faster and more cost-effective way to enter new markets and expand brand presence. As the global marketplace continues to evolve, franchising is likely to remain a popular and effective model for businesses looking to expand their operations."
"Business process reengineering (BPR) is a management approach that aims to radically redesign and streamline an organization's business processes to improve performance, efficiency, and customer satisfaction. It involves a complete rethink of the organization's structure, systems, and processes, with a focus on eliminating waste, reducing costs, and improving quality. BPR has been widely adopted by organizations seeking to transform their operations and achieve significant improvements in productivity, profitability, and competitiveness.

The impact of BPR on organizational change can be profound. By challenging existing assumptions and rethinking established processes, BPR can drive a cultural shift within an organization that is necessary for sustained change. BPR can also create a sense of urgency and commitment to change by highlighting the need for fundamental transformation and demonstrating the potential benefits that can be achieved.

BPR often involves the use of technology to automate and streamline business processes. This can lead to a more efficient and streamlined operation, as well as the elimination of manual processes that can be error-prone and time-consuming. The use of technology can also enable organizations to capture and analyze data more effectively, which can lead to better decision-making and more informed strategic planning.

However, the implementation of BPR can also be challenging. It requires significant resources, including time, money, and personnel, and can be disruptive to the organization. Resistance to change is also common, as employees may feel threatened by the prospect of radical change or may be resistant to new ways of working. To successfully implement BPR, organizations must be committed to change, communicate the rationale and benefits of the change to employees, and provide adequate training and support throughout the process.

In conclusion, BPR is a management approach that can have a profound impact on organizational change. By radically redesigning and streamlining business processes, BPR can drive a cultural shift within an organization and create a sense of urgency and commitment to change. While the implementation of BPR can be challenging, it offers organizations the opportunity to achieve significant improvements in productivity, efficiency, and competitiveness, and to position themselves for long-term success in a rapidly changing business environment.","That concludes our discussion on the impact of business process reengineering on organizational change. BPR has the potential to transform an organization's operations, drive cultural change, and improve productivity, efficiency, and competitiveness. However, it requires significant resources and can be disruptive to the organization, which means that successful implementation requires a commitment to change, effective communication, and adequate training and support. As organizations continue to adapt to changing market conditions and customer demands, BPR will likely remain a valuable tool for achieving sustained change and long-term success."
